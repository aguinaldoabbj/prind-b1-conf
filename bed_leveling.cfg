#After a BED_MESH_CALIBRATE has been performed, 
#it is possible to save the current mesh state into a named profile. 
#This makes it possible to load a mesh without re-probing the bed. 
#After a profile has been saved using BED_MESH_PROFILE SAVE=<name> 
#the SAVE_CONFIG gcode may be executed to write the profile to printer.cfg.
#Profiles can be loaded by executing BED_MESH_PROFILE LOAD=<name>.
#It should be noted that each time a BED_MESH_CALIBRATE occurs, 
#the current state is automatically saved to the default profile. 
#If this profile exists it is automatically loaded when Klipper starts. 
#If this behavior is not desirable the default profile can be removed as follows:
#BED_MESH_PROFILE REMOVE=default
#Any other saved profile can be removed in the same fashion, 
#replacing default with the named profile you wish to remove.

[z_tilt]
z_positions:
  0,117.5
  235,117.5
#   A list of X,Y coordinates (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) describing the location of each bed "pivot point". The
#   "pivot point" is the point where the bed attaches to the given Z
#   stepper. It is described using nozzle coordinates (the XY position
#   of the nozzle if it could move directly above the point). The
#   first entry corresponds to stepper_z, the second to stepper_z1,
#   the third to stepper_z2, etc. This parameter must be provided.
points:
  10,117.5
  225,117.5
#   A list of X,Y coordinates (one per line; subsequent lines
#   indented) that should be probed during a Z_TILT_ADJUST command.
#   Specify coordinates of the nozzle and be sure the probe is above
#   the bed at the given nozzle coordinates. This parameter must be
#   provided.
speed: 200
#   The speed (in mm/s) of non-probing moves during the calibration.
#   The default is 50.
horizontal_move_z: 5
#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
retries: 10
#   Number of times to retry if the probed points aren't within
#   tolerance.
retry_tolerance: .05
#   If retries are enabled then retry if largest and smallest probed
#   points differ more than retry_tolerance. Note the smallest unit of
#   change here would be a single step. However if you are probing
#   more points than steppers then you will likely have a fixed
#   minimum value for the range of probed points which you can learn
#   by observing command output.
